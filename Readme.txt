We have used R Studio to implement the project in R language.

It uses twitteR API. It also used the following packages that need to be installed if not present:
library(twitteR)
library(ROAuth)
require(RCurl)
library(stringr)
library(tm)
library(ggmap)
library(dplyr)
library(plyr)
library(tm)
library(wordcloud)

Enter the following information in the code:
key="key"
secret="secret key"
accessToken="access token"
accessSecret="access secret"

Also set working directory in setwd() function.

Now run the code file Project_Code.R in R studio.
